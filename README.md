# VATSIM-data

To show user data with given CID. IT IS NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL MEANING SOME CIDs MIGHT REURN AN ERROR, on the other side, vACC website developers if you have an online API I can integrate that inside to show more and more information about a user. Like if the home facility is x for example, if I have x's website API I can show certifications or stuff.

At the moment implemented:
ZHU ARTCC API (https://api.zhuartcc.org)

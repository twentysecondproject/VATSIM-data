# VATSIM-data

You just need to have Python installed. Double Click on the data.py and follow the instructions.

vACC/Division/Region website developers, if you have an online API to get more user data like certifications or other things (not personal like Email or Age) please share them, I would love to implement them!




### At the moment implemented:

`ZHU ARTCC API (https://api.zhuartcc.org)`

`ZJX ARTCC API (https://zjxartcc.org/api)`

`VATUSA Division API (https://api.vatusa.net)`

`VATSIM API (https://api.vatsim.net/api)`







### To be implemented:

`Port Au Prince FIR API (Coming soon with new website)`

If you want to submit your API open a Pull Request and add yours in 'to be implemented'.

### What does the script do?
It is able to return:

`User data. (with CID input)`

`Metar at an airport. (With ICAO Input)`

`Online controllers at an airport. (With ICAO (IATA if in the US) input)`
